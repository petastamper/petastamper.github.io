      <p>The Barge House has an all-day menu, but it’s their brunches that pack as they describe, “One Hell of a Breakfast”! Their signature ‘Breakfast In Bread’ has taken social media by storm: a whole sourdough loaf hollowed out then packed with your breakfast favourites, from salmon to eggs and asparagus. 
        </p>

      <p>But more than just a delicious treat to share with your pals online, The Barge House speciality contributes towards supporting the local community. 
        Each loaf is baked by The Better Health Bakery, a charitable artisan bakery and social enterprise they bring the community together supporting wellbeing & recovery from mental health.
        “We worked in partnership with their Head Baker to create our bespoke sourdough loaf, developing the perfect mix to hold all the goodness of the Breakfast in Bread.”</p>
