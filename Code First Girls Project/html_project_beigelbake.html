      <p>The Beigel Bake is a 24 hour bakery on Brick Lane, founded in 1974, in the heart of Shoreditch - yes, you read correctly, it is open all hours of the day and night to satisfy your beigel needs! The Beigel Bake's hours have meant this institution has fast become a place for post-night out meals, earning it a spot in London's most shared food spots on social media.

      <p>But this small Jewish bakery is also a star of FoodFeed because those traditional boiled-before-baked beigels are packed with delicious delicatessan foodstuffs, from pastrami or salt beef and pickle to a classic cream cheese and salmon. Controversially, there is debate over which of the Brick Lane bagel shops is better: The Yellow One or The White One (Beigel Bake). The Yellow One has been around for over a century, but sells bacon, which White One fans claim is un-Jewish and blasphemous on a beigel. Honestly, they're both great. Perhaps just join the shorter queue?</p>
